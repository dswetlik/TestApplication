# Concession Cashier Calculator

For my Mobile Computing class, we had to design and implement a small application that would assist cashiers in totaling up purchased goods, along with saving items created in an Administration screen. This was our first project in the class, it was meant to be a very small application to get a general idea of what it was like to work with Kotlin in Android Studio. For our second project our professor let us work on whatever we wanted, so I decided to expand on this application. I added a splash screen, the seperate administration screen, the ability to update already created items, and several QoL things.

It takes several clicks to get to the actual code of the project, so instead of doing that here is a link to access it directly: https://github.com/dswetlik/TestApplication/tree/master/app/src/main/java/edu/coe/swetlik/myapplication
